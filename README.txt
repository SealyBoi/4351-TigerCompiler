It (should) all work. I tested the queens.tig file and it worked fine so I'm assuming that it'll work for the lesser files as well.
There may be some compilation error with `d0 or `s0 or whatever I named it, as for some I accidentally typed ' instead of `.
I went back and changed the ones I could find, but this is just a small warning just in case something slipped through.
